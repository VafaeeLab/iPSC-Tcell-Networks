# iPSC-Tcell-Networks
Network-based transcriptomic framework for characterising in vivo and iPSC-derived T cells using single-cell RNA-seq. Identifies co-expressed gene modules that define T cell differentiation, maturity, and cytokine responsiveness, enabling systems-level comparison across distinct iPSC-derived T cell protocols.
